# Bookmark-iOS

A community built around sharing and reading your favourite books.

The feature that we were not able to thumbnail images for authors and book covers using this API https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/covers.

The sample JSON data for the books was obtained from https://gist.github.com/nanotaboada/6396437 (Bippity Boppity, your JSON is now my property.)
